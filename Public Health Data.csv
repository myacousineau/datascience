Because of challenges in collecting direct measures of HIV incidence, modelled estimates are used (the Spectrum software). The models incorporate data on HIV prevalence from surveys of the general population, antenatal clinic attendees, and populations at increased risk of contracting HIV (such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs) and on the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy, which will increase the prevalence of HIV because people living with HIV now survive longer. In countries with high-quality health information systems the models are also informed by case reporting and vital registration data.","Despite the existence of effective medications and treatment, HIV/AIDS is still a leading cause of death and public health threat in the world.  Low and middle income countries continue to bear a disproportionate share of the global burden of HIV/AIDS. The incidence rate provides a measure of progress toward preventing onward transmission of HIV. Also, the identification of newly infected persons will allow for interventions to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.",,This is the Sustainable Development Goal indicator 3.3.1 [https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/].,,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by

Youth rates are as a percentage of the relevant age group.",UNAIDS estimates.,Health: Risk factors,Annual,Weighted average,"HIV prevalence rates reflect the rate of HIV infection in each country's population. Low national prevalence rates can be misleading, however. They often disguise epidemics that are initially concentrated in certain localities or population groups and threaten to spill over into the wider population. In many developing countries most new infections occur in young adults, with young women especially vulnerable.

Data on HIV are from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Changes in procedures and assumptions for estimating the data and better coordination with countries have resulted in improved estimates of HIV and AIDS. The models, which are routinely updated, track the course of HIV epidemics and their impact, making full use of information in HIV prevalence trends from surveillance data as well as survey data. The models take into account reduced infectivity among people receiving antiretroviral therapy (which is having a larger impact on HIV prevalence and allowing HIV-positive people to live longer) and allow for changes in urbanization over time in generalized epidemics. The estimates include plausibility bounds, which reflect the certainty associated with each of the estimates.",,The limited availability of data on health status is a major constraint in assessing the health situation in developing countries. Surveillance data are lacking for many major public health concerns. Estimates of prevalence and incidence are available for some diseases but are often unreliable and incomplete.

Prompt and effective treatment of malaria is a critical element of malaria control. It is vital that sufferers, especially children under age 5, start treatment within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, to prevent progression - often rapid - to severe malaria and death.

All forms of TB are included, including cases in people living with HIV. Estimates for all years are recalculated as new information becomes available and techniques are refined, so they may differ from those published previously.","World Health Organization, Global Tuberculosis Report.",Health: Risk factors,Annual,Weighted average,"Tuberculosis is one of the main causes of adult deaths from a single infectious agent in developing countries. In developed countries tuberculosis has reemerged largely as a result of cases among immigrants. Since tuberculosis incidence cannot be directly measured, estimates are obtained by eliciting expert opinion or are derived from measurements of prevalence or mortality.",,"The limited availability of data on health status is a major constraint in assessing the health situation in developing countries. Surveillance data are lacking for many major public health concerns. Estimates of prevalence and incidence are available for some diseases but are often unreliable and incomplete.

The data shown here are based on an assessment of national immunization coverage rates by the WHO and UNICEF. The assessment considered both administrative data from service providers and household survey data on children's immunization histories. Based on the data available, consideration of potential biases, and contributions of local experts, the most likely true level of immunization coverage was determined for each year.

Notes on regional and global aggregates: When the vaccine is not introduced in a national immunization schedule, the missing value is assumed zero (or close to zero) in the relevant groups' averages.","Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, and ??is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality. Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts.",In many developing countries a lack of precise information on the size of the cohort of one-year-old children makes immunization coverage difficult to estimate from program statistics.,,,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
